I am not entirely sure why this project came after the Guessing Game. I felt like that was much harder. This project essentially was more of the same, but also introduced the concept of the event object, different types of "key" events (keydown, keypress, keyup). I decided to experiment with the REST operator as well, to ever so slightly shorten some code - instead of calling element.classList.toggle() twice (once for the modal and once more for the overlay element) I used the REST operator to create a function that can take any number of arguments of type Element and iterate through them, toggling the "hidden" class on every Element argument.
